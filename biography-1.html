      <p>My short-term goal is to apply for an internship in web design. Because I want to increase my experience in my career. And got accepted to Hunter college or Baruch college. Now I have been admitted to the college I want. I have thought about which college is more suitable for me, Baruch college is more suitable for economics, and the diversity of Hunter college is more suitable for me, so I may choose Hunter college in the future. My long-term goal is to do my degree in college, get a degree and find a career I love. </p>
     <p>I like drawing because I am very interested in drawing. I draw when I have free time but haven't learned to draw. It's just my interest so I don't get bored. So I apply </p>
